Data Structures and Algorithms examples in JavaScript

### Space Complexity

How much memory is used?

### Time Complexity

How many primitive operations are executed?

### Loops to find min and max of array

Nested loops: O(N^2) time complexity
Two separate loops: O(2N) time complexity

### Sorted List find min and max of array

Constant time complexity: O(2) AKA O(1)

### Big O Notations from fast to slow

Constant: O(1)
Logarithmic: O(logN)
Linear: O(N)
Quadratic: O(N^2)
Exponential: O(K^N)
